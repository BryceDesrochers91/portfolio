<!-- 2 paragraphs on what I gained in terms of knowledge this semester. -->

I learned a lot more complex termonology and code this semester. For example, learning how to animate areas of code to shrink, grow, flip, spin and how to fade content in and out. I also learned Bootstrap, which I wish I could have learned it earlier because it makes life easier and I barely have to touch CSS. 

I also learned how to resize images to be able to look nice and neat on the webpage. Then I learned how to make one of the nav ul's into a drop-down menu to add more content to the website. I would like to thank Lucille for being my transcriber and speeding up my process in terms of coding. Also thanks for Rob being a good professor and teaching us all these amazing web development skills.
